# Raven example

This page was made to illustrate the Raven library for data binding. It allows us to create a store and bind its properties to input elements on the screen, without the need for frameworks.

You can read more on the library on the <a href="https://https://github.com/isacvale/dvo-raven">Raven Github repository</a>.
